BASE RELEASE:

	compile and package for windows and osx
	render comparison image
	sample_bokeh not working on windows? Check differences
	why are some of the infinity focuses so off? might have to adjust them
	previous focus made nicer bokeh with petzval.. Why? Which one is the most correct?

	compute focal length before lens generation so I can properly match the lenses


POINT RELEASES:
	fix nans of double gauss angenieux
	check for intersections along P->Lens path
	come up with better triggering of backtracing, based on sample intensity, distance from focal point, fstop, ..?
	implement ray-reverse function to support viewport tessellation, adaptive subdivision, etc
	add more lens descriptions (different focal lengths)
	fix clipping, not sure why but pota's is closer than the perspective camera by a factor of 10
